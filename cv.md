## Personal Info
My professional field is copywriting. I worked as a technical writer (2017â€“2020) and as a commercial author in email marketing. Last year I decided to get back into the tech-sphere. Since then, I've been working as a remote technical writer in a company based in Luxembourg.

First *(and primitive, as I've already understood)* front-end tasks I faced long ago when applying some MD markup for article editing. Then I tried to study style and markup languages *(which are not languages, hoho)*several times. But they won. In summer 22, I did the current *(hope, last)* attempt. Since that moment, I've learned HTML5, CSS, and the basics of JS.

I consider that regular education, strong desire, and straight goal can lead you to success *(although info-gypsy coaches are annoying and not motivating)*. And I'm willing to work hard to become a Junior Frontend Developer.

## Skills 
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript (very basics)
- Figma
